# Quantum Machine Learning

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks demonstrating fundamental concepts in Quantum Machine Learning (QML) and Quantum Computing.

> **Note:** This project is just getting started! Expect more notebooks covering advanced topics and algorithms to be added soon.

## Contents

The project is structured into the following modules:

1.  **[Measurement](qml/qml_1_measurement.ipynb)**
    *   Introduction to quantum measurement principles.

2.  **[Bell State](qml/qml_2_bell_state.ipynb)**
    *   Exploration of Bell states and quantum entanglement.

3.  **[Quantum Teleportation](qml/qml_3_quantum_teleporatation.ipynb)**
    *   Implementation of the quantum teleportation protocol.

4.  **[Random Number Generator](qml/qml_4_random_num_generator.ipynb)**
    *   Using quantum mechanics to generate true random numbers.

## Getting Started

To run these notebooks, ensure you have a Python environment set up with the necessary quantum computing libraries.

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.x
*   Jupyter Notebook

## Usage

Clone the repository and launch Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd quantum_machine_learning
jupyter notebook
```

Navigate to the `qml` folder and open the notebooks to follow along.

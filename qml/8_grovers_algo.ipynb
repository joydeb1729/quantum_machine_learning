    "# Grover's Algorithm: An Intuitive and Complete Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Core Objective: Quadratic Speedup\n",
    "\n",
    "In **classical computing**, searching for a specific item in an *unsorted* database of $N$ items requires checking items one by one. In the worst case, this takes $O(N)$ operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Grover's algorithm** provides a **quadratic speedup** by finding the desired item using only $O(\\sqrt{N})$ oracle queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "This speedup is achieved through **amplitude amplification**: the probability amplitude of the correct (winner) state is increased, while the amplitudes of all incorrect (loser) states are decreased.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Initialization and Equal Superposition\n",
    "\n",
    "### Database Encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "We use $n$ qubits to represent a database of size  \n",
    "$$N = 2^n.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Each computational basis state $|x\\rangle$ corresponds to one database item.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating the Equal Superposition\n",
    "\n",
    "All qubits are initialized to $|0\\rangle^{\\otimes n}$. Applying a Hadamard gate to each qubit produces an equal superposition over all possible inputs:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "|\\psi_{\\text{in}}\\rangle\n",
    "= H^{\\otimes n} |0\\rangle^{\\otimes n}\n",
    "= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}} \\sum_{x=0}^{N-1} |x\\rangle.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "At this stage, every item has the same probability $1/N$ of being measured.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Target Qubit and Phase Kickback\n",
    "\n",
    "To mark the correct item **without disturbing probabilities directly**, we introduce one auxiliary **target qubit**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preparing the Target Qubit\n",
    "\n",
    "The target qubit is initialized in the state:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "|-\\rangle = \\frac{|0\\rangle - |1\\rangle}{\\sqrt{2}}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The combined system state becomes:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "|\\psi_1\\rangle = |\\psi_{\\text{in}}\\rangle \\otimes |-\\rangle.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This special state enables **phase kickback**, a key quantum trick used by the oracle.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. The Oracle Transformation ($U_f$)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Defining the Oracle Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The oracle encodes the solution $k$ using a Boolean function:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f(x) =\n",
    "\\begin{cases}\n",
    "1, & x = k \\quad \\text{(winner)} \\\\\n",
    "0, & x \\neq k \\quad \\text{(losers)}\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Oracle Action\n",
    "\n",
    "The oracle unitary acts as:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "U_f |x\\rangle |y\\rangle = |x\\rangle |y \\oplus f(x)\\rangle.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "When the target qubit is in the $|-\\rangle$ state, flipping it introduces a **phase change** on the input state. This gives:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "U_f |x\\rangle = (-1)^{f(x)} |x\\rangle.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Effect of the Oracle\n",
    "\n",
    "Only the winner state acquires a negative sign:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "|\\psi_2\\rangle\n",
    "= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}} \\sum_{x \\neq k} |x\\rangle\n",
    "- \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}} |k\\rangle.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, **probabilities remain unchanged**, but the *phase* of the correct state is flipped.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Geometric Interpretation: A 2D State Space\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the system lives in a $2^n$-dimensional space, Grover's algorithm operates entirely in a **two-dimensional subspace**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basis Vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "We define two orthonormal states:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Winner state**: $|k\\rangle$\n",
    "- **Non-winner superposition**:\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  |c\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N-1}} \\sum_{x \\neq k} |x\\rangle\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decomposition of the Initial State\n",
    "\n",
    "The equal superposition can be written as:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "|\\psi_{\\text{in}}\\rangle = \\sin \\theta \\, |k\\rangle + \\cos \\theta \\, |c\\rangle,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sin \\theta = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, the state vector is very close to $|c\\rangle$ and far from $|k\\rangle$.\n",

    "\n",
    "One **Grover iteration** consists of two reflections that together form a rotation.\n",

    "\n",
    "Geometrically, this reflects the state across the $|c\\rangle$ axis.\n",

    "The diffusion operator reflects the state about the equal superposition:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "U_{\\psi_{\\text{eq}}} = 2|\\psi_{\\text{eq}}\\rangle \\langle \\psi_{\\text{eq}}| - I.\n",

    "\\cos 2\\theta & \\sin 2\\theta \\\\\n",
    "\\sin 2\\theta & -\\cos 2\\theta\n",

    "= \\cos 3\\theta \\, |c\\rangle + \\sin 3\\theta \\, |k\\rangle.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Result\n",
    "\n",
    "Each Grover iteration **rotates the state vector by an angle $2\\theta$ toward $|k\\rangle$**, steadily increasing the probability of measuring the correct answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Example Case: $N = 4$\n",
    "\n",
    "For a 2-qubit database:\n",

    "P(\\text{success}) = \\sin^2(90^\\circ) = 1.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the correct item is found with certainty in **one iteration**.\n",

    "|\\psi_{\\text{eq}}\\rangle = H^{\\otimes n} |0\\rangle^{\\otimes n}.\n",

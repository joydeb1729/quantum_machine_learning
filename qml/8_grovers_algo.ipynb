    "\n",
    "**Grover's algorithm** provides a **quadratic speedup** by finding the desired item using only $O(\\sqrt{N})$ oracle queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "This speedup is achieved through **amplitude amplification**: the probability amplitude of the correct (winner) state is increased, while the amplitudes of all incorrect (loser) states are decreased.\n",
